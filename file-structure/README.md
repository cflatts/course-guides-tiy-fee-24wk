JS File Structure
-----------------------

This is boilerplate for an intro to JS level project:

```
[ROOT DIRECTORY NAME]
|
|---js
	|---[FILENAME.js]

|---styles
	|---[FILENAME.css]

|---index.html
|---.editorconfig
|---.eslintrc.json
|---.gitignore
```

> **Note**

>- The `[FILENAME].js` should indicate what homework problem you are working and if it is a blank project, not related to homework, use `main.js`

>- There can be multiple `js` files, put a script tag linking to each one in the HTML file

>- The `[FILENAME].css`should be `styles.css` if you only have one

>- This is the **MINIMUM** file structure, feel free to include SCSS as well.

>- Follow the other rules for [code styling](https://github.com/cflatts/code-styling)

## Basic HTML File Structure

This is the boilerplate for any basic HTML project:

```
|-- my-project-name
|   |-- css
|   |   |-- [FILENAME.css]
|   |-- js
|   |   |-- [FILENAME.js]
|   |-- .editorconfig
|   |-- .eslintrc.js
|   |-- .gitignore
|   |-- index.html
```

**Notes:**

- The `[FILENAME].js` should indicate what homework problem you are working and
  if it is a blank project, not related to homework, use `main.js`

- There can be multiple `.js` files, put a script tag linking to each one in the
  HTML file (at the bottom because we like things to load fast).

- The `[FILENAME].css`should be `styles.css` if you only have one.

- This is the **MINIMUM** file structure, feel free to include SCSS as well.
